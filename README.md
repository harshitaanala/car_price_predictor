# Car Price Predictior

The Car Price Predictor project is a machine learning application that predicts the price of cars based on various features using linear regression. It aims to assist users, such as car buyers or sellers, in estimating the market value of a vehicle based on its specifications. This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to real-world data and showcases the predictive capabilities of linear regression in the automotive industry.

Features
Dataset: Utilizes a dataset containing information about various cars, including features like mileage, engine size, horsepower, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
Linear Regression Model: Implements a linear regression model to learn from the dataset and predict car prices.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of the model using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to measure accuracy.
Prediction Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface where users can input car specifications and receive a predicted price.
Deployment: Deploys the model as a web application or API, allowing seamless integration into websites or other applications.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model development, and deployment.
Scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning tasks, including building and evaluating regression models.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library used for handling the dataset.
Flask: Web framework used for developing the prediction interface and deploying the model as a web application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for creating a user interface to interact with the model predictions.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for responsive design and layout of the web interface.
